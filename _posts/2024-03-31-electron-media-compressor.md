## Overview
A lightweight, desktop app built with Electron to compress media files (images, videos, etc). Multiple media files can be selected & compressed.
Output files are currently stored in the local filesystem and the user can view the content via the app.

The application utilizes native desktop OS capabilities (file dialog, native file viewer). The frontend of the app is built using ReactJS. The main process handling is performed using NodeJS
